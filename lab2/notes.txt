webservers will send out random segmented images. Each image is segmeneted 50 times. Use threads to call each webserver to obtain all 50 segments.

CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION is the option to write the received data. To pass in the userdata, use the command CURLOPT_WRITEDATA

Using pthreads, create n amount of threads and upon thread completion, append the cURL data to the img png array.

Each image from webserver will be less than 8Kb.

USE Mutex to lock array of PNG's so that only one thread can write to it at a time.

When thread is about to write to PNG array, lock perform a mutex lock before accessing array. Then unlock after finishing
writing to it.
